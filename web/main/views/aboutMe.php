        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi!  I am Kat.  I am studying web design and development and am diligently 
        working towards my BS in Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p>I currently work full time as a loan officer for a local credit union. This
        has been able to teach me fortitude and determination.  I have learned to not
        give up on your goals no matter what.  You never know what might be just a 
        phone call away.</p>
        <p>I have had the opportunity to live all over the United States.  This has included
        23 moves, all of which happened before I was 23. I have learned the value of being flexible
        and to quickly be able to change with what you are handed in life.</p>
        <p>I have several talents that I enjoy working on.  I love to play the French Horn, dance,
        sing, quilt, and many more things. These activities have all taught me the value of practice,
        paitence, repetition, and to stick with it until you understand it. My love for creating is
        also one of the things that led me to this major and hopefully career path.</p>
